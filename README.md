# dijkstras-algorithm-python
This is a basic implementation of Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm for Python.

This is part of the 2021-1 Telecommunication Networks course.

**Vertex.py**
Class containing Vertex object, necessary for building graphs.

**Graph.py**
Class containing Graph object. This is a data type consisting of vertices and nodes.

**Dijkstra.py**
This is the implementation of the algorithm. It needs to be provided a graph and a root node.
